# Odin Sign-up Form Project

Another assignment from The Odin Project curriculum. You can check the brief here:

## Approach

I designed a monogram for myself and will be using that instead of the generic Odin logo.  
Also planning on spicing it up with another graphic I made for my side-project, Granoturco.

Still using vanilla HTML and CSS. Not sure I'll need JS for form validation here, but it may be the case.
